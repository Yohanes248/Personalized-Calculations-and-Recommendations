# Personalized-Calculations-and-Recommendations

## Description  
This project focuses on creating modular functions to perform various tasks based on user inputs and specified conditions. The functionalities include:  

- **Gift Recommendations:** Suggesting thoughtful gifts by analyzing user preferences and budget constraints.  
- **Student Grade Calculation:** Computing weighted scores and translating them into letter grades for academic evaluations.  
- **Bookstore Pricing:** Determining eligibility for discounts and calculating the final cost of books based on category and user criteria.  

The code demonstrates the application of functions, conditional logic, and arithmetic operations to address real-world scenarios efficiently. It highlights the power of combining calculations with decision-making processes to automate and simplify practical problems.
